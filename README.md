# React File Nesting Explorer

Build large React applications with ease by organizing your files in a minimalistic way. This extension allows you to nest your files in a tree structure, making it easier to compose your components and navigate your project.

> Note: This extension is not the same as the [VSCode's File Nesting](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67#_explorer-file-nesting) and is not integrated with it.
